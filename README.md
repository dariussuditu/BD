## Business Model Overview

The database supports a chain of pizzerias with multiple locations across various cities, allowing customers to place orders, make reservations, and receive promotions. Key entities include customers, orders, employees, menu items, and reviews. The database structure ensures data integrity through defined relationships, constraints, and normalization to streamline operations across the chain.

### Project Highlights

- **Entity and Relationship Modeling**: Developed entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to map out the relationships and dependencies within the business structure.
- **Database Normalization**: Ensured 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to reduce redundancy and maintain data consistency.
- **Table Creation and Constraints**: Defined primary and foreign key constraints for data integrity across tables.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Added SQL procedures for key operations, such as retrieving popular pizzas per location and generating customer order summaries.
- **Sample Data Insertion**: Populated tables with sample data for testing, covering customers, orders, employees, and menu items.
- **Created SQL Queries**: Wrote PL/SQL queries that operate on the database.
